    "        It should be clear that as we increase the strength of the oscillations in the integrand (controlled by the parameter $\\alpha$) we are forced to introduce more and more grid points to produce an accurate approximation. This is a consequence of the fact that for highly oscillatory functions, in order to resolve them well, it is necessary to have a fine mesh/grid  Therefore, for a highly oscillatory integrand, the computational cost associated with brute force numerical quadrature quickly becomes intractable. \n",

    "       One may observe that as the amplitude of the fluctuations ($\\alpha$) is increased, the stationary phase approximation becomes an increasinly accurate estimate of the original integral. This is due to the fact that if we increase the rapidity of the fluctuations in the integrand, as we move away from the point of stationary phase, the contributions to the integral shall become increasingly negligible. Thus, an approximation of the integral by its behaviour in the vicinity of the point where its integrand's phase is stationary becomes a progressively more faithful representation of the integral as a whole. In addition, one can note that by increasing the integration limits, the value obtained through numerical quadrature and via the stationary phase approximation become better and better aligned. Note: it may be necessary to increase the number of grid points used in the numerical quadrature scheme as the integration limits are increased in order to achieve sufficient convergence of this estimate. This latter fact again illustrates the difficulty in computing such oscillatory integrals numerically; the breakdown at large integration limits is due to the increased strength of oscillations in the integrand far\n",

    "       Following the procedure outlined in the accompanying theory notebook we Taylor expand (up to second order) around the stationary point the argument of the exponential $f(x) = e^{F(x)}$, with $F(x) =  e ^{x^2}-1)$.

Consequently, we may then write $\\int \\limits_{-L}^{L} dx e^{i\\alpha( e ^{x^2}-1)} \\approx \\int \\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx e^{i \\alpha x^2}$.
